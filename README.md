# CopyTableNamesToCopTranslations
Esker work tool. 

This is a tool that I wrote for a user story. It copies some filtered table translations from some xml language files to other xml language files.

Use the "CopyTableNamesToCopTranslations.Core.Tests" project to execute the code. The other projects need different dependecies and xml files to be executed on other environments than mine.

And, hence it was a small and (kind of) a standalone project, I decided to modify it and use it to illustrate a Dependency Injection article on Medium.
